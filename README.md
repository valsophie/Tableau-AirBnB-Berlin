# Tableau Project 

This Project is the extension on our AirBnb group work. 
This time, I used Data from 2019/2020 on Berlins AirBnB market and visulized 
the number of listings by neighborhood, the average prices, the number of listings per hosts, and the availability of listings throughout the year. This way, I tried to gain more insights on the commercial use of AirBnB compared to the initial concept of "Homesharing"

This is the link to the data : http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
The files were unfortunately too large to share in this repo.
